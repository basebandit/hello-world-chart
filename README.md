# Hello-World-Chart

This is a simple chart that I created while learning the basics of helm and its charts.

## Pre-requisite
- Ensure you have a running kubernetes cluster.
- Have helm installed and add the bitnami repo.   
`helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami`

## Installation.
- To install the chart run the command.  
`helm install <release-name> ./hello-world-chart`
